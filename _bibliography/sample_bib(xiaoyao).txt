  abstract={
    Real-world network configurations play a critical role in network management and
    research tasks. While valuable, data holders of ten hesitate to share them due to
    business and privacy concerns. Existing methods are deficient in concealing the
    implicit information that can be inferred from configurations, such as topology and
    routing paths. To address this, we present ConfMask, a novel framework designed to
    systematically anonymize network topology and routing paths in configurations. Our
    approach tackles key privacy, utility, and scalability challenges, which arise from
    the strong dependency between different datasets and complex routing protocols. Our
    anonymization algorithm is scalable to large networks and effectively mitigates
    de-anonymization risk. Moreover, it maintains essential network properties such as
    reachability, waypointing and multi-path consistency, making it suitable for a wide
    range of downstream tasks. Compared to existing dataplane anonymization algorithm
    (i.e., NetHide), ConfMask reduces ~75% specification differences between the
    original and the anonymized networks.
