This is the collection of my open source contributions to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a Python module for machine learning. It has its code base maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), with over 2500 contributors.

I am currently a core developer of scikit-learn and also a member of its documentation team. You may check out [the people behind scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#the-people-behind-scikit-learn), my [blog interview on board](https://blog.scikit-learn.org/team/yao-interview/), and my current [contributor ranking](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/graphs/contributors).

## Partial Contributions

Here I will list some of my non-trivial contributions and experiences that I want to share.

- `neighbors.KernelDensity` may change its behavior in a future version! Check out [this blog post](/blog/2024/scikit-learn-kde/) to see why.
- I led the rework of the scikit-learn main website, deployed since version 1.5. Check out [this blog post](/blog/2024/scikit-learn-website-rework/) for more details.
