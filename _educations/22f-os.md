## Labs

### Lab 2: nyush

[Shell-nyush](https://gitfront.io/r/Charlie-XIAO/jwtwvd6UYbWL/Shell-nyush/), a.k.a. **N**ew **Y**et **U**sable **Sh**ell, is an implementation of a simple version of the Linux shell. It is an interactive command-line program, involving process creation, destruction, and management, signal handling, and I/O redirection. Basic functionality include:

- Program locating and execution.
- Process termination and suspension.
- Signal handling.
- I/O redirection (including piping).
- Built-in commands (including `cd`, `exit`, `jobs`, and `fg`).

### Lab 3: nyuenc

[Encoder-nyuenc](https://gitfront.io/r/Charlie-XIAO/ftboF2oUd5yt/Encoder-nyuenc/), a.k.a. **N**ot **Y**our **U**sual **Enc**oder, is an implementation of a parallelized [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) (RLE). Multiple threads are created to encode in parallel, leading to better performance. In order to avoid frequent creation and destruction of threads, a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool) is implemented to maintain a certain number of threads, specified by a flag. [POSIX threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pthreads) is used in this lab, and mutual exclusions and conditional variables are used for elimination of race conditions. Basic functionality include:

- Supports a `-j` flag. If specified, the corresponding number of threads will be initialized in a thread pool. Otherwise, the encoding will be done sequentially.

- Implements [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) (RLE).

- Free of race conditions or busy waiting among threads to achieve high and stable parallelization.

### Lab 4: nyufile

[FileRecovery-nyufile](https://gitfront.io/r/Charlie-XIAO/j2q46W3w8FUF/FileRecovery-nyufile/), a.k.a, **N**eed **Y**ou to **U**ndelete My **File**, is a program for recovering deleted files in a FAT32 file system. Its usage is as follows:

{% highlight plaintext %}
Usage: ./nyufile disk <options>
-i Print the file system information.
-l List the root directory.
-r filename [-s sha1] Recover a contiguous file.
-R filename -s sha1 Recover a possibly non-contiguous file.
{% endhighlight %}

Basic functionality include:

- Adapts to different configurations of FAT32 disks.

- Provides reliable file recovery as long as the file contents are not rewritten.

- Searches by file size for contiguously allocated fata blocks and recovers the file.

- Searches by brute force permutation for non-contiguously allocated data blocks given the SHA1 hash of the file contents and recovers the file.

You may access the source code [here](https://gitfront.io/r/Charlie-XIAO/j2q46W3w8FUF/FileRecovery-nyufile/), and note that you should run it in a Linux environment.
